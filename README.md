# Currency Converter

mini project to learn Php and database(mysqli).  

## objectives  
Main objective was to create a currency converter implementing an API (used this one) and a form where the client can add the amount to convert and the countries.  
The database was used to store all the different currencies of different countries (first time I worked with and create a database).


### bonus
I tried to work with OOP and namespaces , topics that are quite advanced and were not required ...first time I used it with an external help of course. I found the extremely interesting and will explore them more from now on.
